# Problem 1

Create a simple Client and Server UDP program in which the server waits for a datagram from client and on receiving datagram it displays the information, sent by the client, in proper format. From the client side you should send your name and roll number. You can either take port number/IP at run time or you can hardcode it. No requirements here.

** Display Format: **
** ROLL NO: LXX-XXXX **
** NAME: XXXXXX **
